# Default Schemas for Tridion
## Version: 0.0.1
## Description

These are some very generic, default schemas that could work for most Tridion 2013 implementations. These schemas were created in an 010 publication labelled: "010 Schemas and Categories". This is a Content Porter Export package. There are two zip files. One uses Pascal Casing for XML Field names, the other uses camel casing.
