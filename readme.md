# Default Schemas for Tridion
## Version: 0.0.2
## Description

These are some very generic, default schemas that could work for most Tridion 2013 implementations. These schemas were created in an 010 publication labelled: "010 Schemas and Categories". 

This is a Content Porter Export package. It should run for SDL Tridion 2013 and lower

Please reference this project's Wiki for details on what's in the schemas.
